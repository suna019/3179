    <h1>Success in AFC Asian Cup 2023</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The AFC Asian Cup 2023 showcased the diversity and quality of football across Asia. 
        Teams from different regions competed with varying strategies and player compositions. 
        This analysis visualises team progression, goal timing, scoring balance, player ages, 
        and impact across the tournament to understand performance trends and key factors.
      </p>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Team's Progression Across the Tournament</h2>
      <div id="map" class="vis-container"></div>
      <div class="text-row">
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            The map highlights how each national team performed
            across the AFC Asian Cup 2023 tournament. Colours and
            borders emphasize how far teams advanced, revealing clear
            differences in stage progression throughout the continent.
            This visualisation helps illustrate overall performance
            levels and competitive strength among participating nations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Western Asian countries generally reached the tournament's
            later stages, while many Eastern teams finished near the
            quarter-finals. Central Asian sides often struggled early,
            reflecting regional disparities in team depth and strategy.
            Together, these outcomes showcase Asia's diverse football
            landscape and highlight where future growth potential lies.
          </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>When Were Goals Scored?</h2>
      <div id="heatmap" class="vis-container"></div>
      <div class="text-row">
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            The heatmap shows when goals were scored across matches.
            Most goals occurred in the final minutes of games.
            Particularly between the 81st and 90th minute of play.
            Early periods had fewer goals, showing cautious openings and defense.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Examining all teams reveals patterns in scoring and defensive actions.
            These trends highlight key moments when teams were most effective.
            Match dynamics evolved over time, shaping overall tournament outcomes.
            Visualisation shows timing's impact on team performance clearly.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Offensive vs Defensive Balance</h2>
      <div id="scatterplot" class="vis-container"></div>
      <div class="text-row">
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            The scatterplot compares goals scored and goals conceded per team.
            Teams near the bottom-right performed strongly both offensively and defensively.
            These points indicate finalists with consistent attack and solid defence.
            Colours show each team's stage, highlighting tournament progression clearly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Points close to the diagonal represent balanced but inconsistent play.
            Here, attack and defence often cancel each other out.
            The bottom-right point represents the tournament winner with top performance.
            This visualisation emphasises scoring efficiency correlating with overall success.
          </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Player Age Distribution per Team</h2>
      <div id="boxplot" class="vis-container"></div>
      <div class="text-row">
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            The boxplot shows the age distribution of players per team.
            Most teams had median ages between 25 and 30 years.
            A few squads included younger players below 20 years old, whereas
            most teams included players over 35 years old, indicating experience
            contributes to success.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Variation in age differs between teams, showing diverse strategies.
            Teams with wider age ranges balanced experience and youthful energy.
            Peak-age players often dominated key positions on the pitch.
            This visual highlights how age composition influenced overall team performance.
          </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Age and Game Impact</h2>
      <div id="stacked_bar" class="vis-container"></div>
      <div class="text-row">
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            This stacked bar chart shows player impact by age group.
            Players aged 26–30 contributed most to goals and assists.
            This reflects peak performance years in international football clearly.
            Younger players, 20–25, showed growing influence mainly as midfielders.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Older players had reduced activity and fewer goal contributions.
            The chart highlights how experience and fitness affect performance.
            Success varies across positions, with age influencing overall tournament impact.
            This visualisation demonstrates patterns of contribution for different age groups.
          </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, the visualisations reveal patterns in team progression, scoring, balance, 
        and player impact across the AFC Asian Cup 2023. Teams combined youth and 
        experience in varying ways, with effective timing, offensive-defensive balance, 
        and peak-age contributions strongly correlating with tournament success.
